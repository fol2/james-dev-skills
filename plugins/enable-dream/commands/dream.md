# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: !`find ~/.claude/projects -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "memory" | head -1 || echo "~/.claude/memory"`

Session transcripts directory: !`ls -d ~/.claude/projects/*/`

**Tool constraints for this run:** Shell access is restricted to read-only commands (`ls`, `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `stat`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, and similar) plus deleting `.md` paths inside the memory directory. Edit is not permitted — memories are immutable, so delete + Write to replace, never edit in place. Plan your exploration with this in mind — no need to probe.

---

## Phase 1 — Orient

- `ls` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read `MEMORY.md` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- `ls -R logs/` — recent activity logs (one file per session under `YYYY/MM/DD/`). If a `sessions/` subdirectory also exists, review recent entries there too

## Phase 2 — Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Session logs** (`logs/YYYY/MM/DD/<id>-<title>.md`) — the append-only activity stream, one file per session. Read the most recent 1–3 days of sessions (the filename title tells you what each was about); each line is prefix-coded (`>` user, `<` assistant, `.` tool call)
2. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
3. **Transcript search** — if you need specific context (e.g., "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms. Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Team memory (`team/` subdirectory)

The `team/` subdirectory holds memories shared across everyone working in this repo. Other teammates' Claude sessions write here too — treat it differently from your personal files:

- **Phase 1:** `ls team/` and skim it alongside your personal files. A teammate may have already captured something you'd otherwise duplicate.
- **Phase 3:** Merge near-duplicates *within* `team/` the same way you would personal memories. If a personal memory restates a team memory, delete the personal one.
- **Phase 4 — be conservative pruning `team/`:**
  - DO delete or fix a team memory that is clearly contradicted by the current code, or that a newer team memory marks as superseded.
  - DO NOT delete a team memory just because you don't recognize it or it isn't relevant to *your* recent sessions — a teammate may rely on it.
  - When unsure, leave it. A stale team memory costs little; deleting a teammate's load-bearing note costs a lot.

Do not promote personal memories into `team/` during a dream — that's a deliberate choice the user makes via `/remember`, not something to do reflexively.

## Phase 3 — Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section — it's the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts — if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 — Prune and index

Update `MEMORY.md` so it stays under 200 lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump — each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file — shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions — if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

### Reconcile memories against CLAUDE.md

Project CLAUDE.md instructions are loaded in your system prompt. For each `feedback` or `project` memory, check whether it contradicts a CLAUDE.md instruction on the same topic:

- **Memory is stale** — CLAUDE.md and the memory describe different procedures for the same task: CLAUDE.md is the maintained, checked-in source. Delete the memory, or rewrite it to agree if it carries context worth keeping (the *why* is still useful but the *how* is wrong).
- **CLAUDE.md may be stale** — the memory is clearly dated after CLAUDE.md and explicitly corrects it: do NOT edit CLAUDE.md during a dream. Annotate the memory with "contradicts CLAUDE.md — verify which is current" and list it in your summary so the user can update CLAUDE.md.
- **Not a conflict** — the memory adds detail CLAUDE.md doesn't cover, or narrows a CLAUDE.md rule with a stated reason. Leave it.

A `feedback` memory's "Why: the user corrected me" framing is not evidence it's newer than CLAUDE.md — CLAUDE.md may have been updated since.

Return a brief summary of what you consolidated, updated, or pruned — include a list of what you deleted, combined, or left alone. If nothing changed (memories are already tight), say so.
